              As a joint collaboration between Data and Design Lab and AGenCy
              Lab with Center for Spatial Information Science (The University of

              Based on easily accessible data from Google Earth, this work
              develops and proposes a new urban environment classification
              method focusing on formality and informality. Firstly, the method
              gives a new model to scrutinize the urban environment based on the
              buildings and their surroundings. Secondly, the method is suited
              for the state-of-the-art machine learning processes that make it
              applicable and scalable for forecasting, analytics, or
              computational modeling. The paper first demonstrates the model and
              its applicability based on the urban environment in the developing
              world. The method divides the urban environment into 16 categories
              under four classes. Then it is used to draw the urban environment
              classes maps of the following emerging cities: Nairobi in Kenya,
              Mumbai in India, Guangzhou in China, Jakarta in Indonesia, Cairo
              in Egypt, and Lima in Chile. The characteristics of the different
              urban environments and the differences between the same class in
              different cities are presented. The paper also demonstrate the
              agility of the proposed method by showing how this classification
              method can be easily augmented with other data such as population
              per square kilometer to aid the decision-making process.
