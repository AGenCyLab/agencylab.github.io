            <p>
              Recently, a general trend in the machine learning research
              community is that most of the research papers include links to the
              code of their experiments. As such, it becomes very much necessary
              to be able to write DRY, scalable, and modular code that can
              easily be used to reproduce experimental results. Additionally, it
              is equally important to be able to tweak the network and dataset
              parameters with minimal effort, which is critical when performing
              ablation studies or simply trying to improve the architecture
              trainable model.

              In an endeavor to enlighten the existing and new RAs in this
              regard, AGenCy Lab of the Centre for Computation and Data Science
              (CCDS), IUB arranged a deep learning code management session at
              the IUB premises on May 24, 2022 (Tuesday) at 7 PM. Our RAs Saif
              Mahmud, Tanjid Hasan Tonmoay, and Mahieyin Rahmun were the
              speakers in the session. They talked about how SOLID and DRY
              principles can help in keeping the codebase modular and manageable
              while at the same time can make working in teams require minimal
              effort. Managing configuration files, project structuring, logging
              and visualization, unit testing, and debugging were discussed.
              Afterward, a short coding session was arranged where the
              participants were required to code a basic image classification
              model and apply the concepts they learned from the session.
